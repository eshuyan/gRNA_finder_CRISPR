# gRNA_finder_CRISPR

Motivation of the project
From our lab and other lab's unpublished results, the GC content and +1 position of gRNA are important for worm genome editing. 
So I write a small program to only select gRNAs with GC content between 50% to 80%, and +1 position is not 'C'.

Version control:

V1: Codes are functional, they will give the gRNA sequences based on the input sequence. Will add off-target rate, and gRNA location in the next version.
